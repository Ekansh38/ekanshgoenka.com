`bc` doesn't know what a megabyte is. Spotlight doesn't remember your block size. This does.

A terminal REPL for programmers doing filesystem math, bitwise work, and unit conversions. Type `2 tb / (4 * kb)` and get 536870912 with a label. Set `block = 4096`, reuse it across expressions. Results copy to clipboard automatically.

Built because `python3 -c "print(128*1024*1024/4096)"` is annoying to type and forgets everything the moment you close it.
